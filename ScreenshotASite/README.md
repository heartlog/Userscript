# Userscript for taking screenshot of manga page that will sava data.
### What it does ?
Simple put, this userscript sends URL of manga chapter 
You're reading to pixwy.com api. That gives screenshot
In raw (photo) format to user.

### What's advantage we get ?
1.  Let's assume normal manga page (black and white) consumes `1.7-3 MB` data.(Colour pages takes more that B&W pages.)
2.  So, a single chapter having roughly 15 pages will 
3.  Takes about `25.5-45 MB`.
4.  You think it's not much but reading only **30 Chapters** Of manga will cost `1350 MB ~1.35 GB` !!!
Let alone completing a manga, can't even read it's Half chapters.

## What id does ?
So, by taking screenshot from external source saves data.
chapter will roughly about `5-6 MB` saves data!

Also, by using this we can save time, where it takes 
Ages to load 1 page on manga site.

### How to use it ?
You can use this in any userscript supporting extension.
But I recommend using Via browser. That is also open Source so you can Download it from play store.
