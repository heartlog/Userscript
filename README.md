# Userscript repository
This repo contains the Userscript made by me while learning about javascript. I personally use these scripts to simplify my web experience.

# What is Userscript ?
A userscript is a small JavaScript program that can be installed and run in a web browser using extensions like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey. Userscripts are used to enhance or modify the behavior of web pages, allowing users to customize their browsing experience. They can add new features, change the appearance of websites, automate tasks, and more. Userscripts are shared through online repositories, where developers upload their scripts for others to install. By injecting custom code into web pages, userscripts empower users to personalize their browsing and make it more efficient and enjoyable.
