# Userscript repository
This is a repository of Userscripts that I created as part of my javascript learning journey. These scripts are tools that I use to enhance and customize my browsing experience.

# What is Userscript ?
One way to improve your web browsing is to use userscripts, which are small programs written in JavaScript that run in your browser with the help of extensions like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey. Userscripts can modify or enhance the functionality of web pages, giving you more control and customization over your online experience. You can use userscripts to add new features, change the look and feel of websites, automate repetitive tasks, and much more. Userscripts are available on online repositories, where you can find and install scripts created by other developers. Userscripts work by injecting custom code into web pages, allowing you to personalize your browsing and make it more productive and fun.
