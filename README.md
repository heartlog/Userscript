# Userscript for manganelo and Bato.to
### What it does ?
Simple put, this userscript sends URL of manga chapter 
You're reading to pixwy.com api. That gives screenshot
In raw (photo) format to user.

### What's advantage we get ?
A normal manga page (b&w) consumes `1.7-3 MB` data.
So, a single chapter having roughly 15 pages will 
Takes about 25.5-45MB.

You think it's not much but reading only 30 Chapters 
Of manga will cost 1350MB ~1.35 GB !!!

Let alone completing a manga, can't even read it's 
Half chapters.
 So, by taking screenshot from external source saves data.
1ful chapter will roughly about 5-6 MB saves data!

Also, by using this we can save time, where it takes 
Ages to load 1 page on manga site.

### How to use it ?
You can use this in any userscript supporting extension.
But I recommend using Via browser. That is also open 
Source so you can Download it from play store.
